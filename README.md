## Getting Started

This program sorts an array using both the bubble sort and selection sort algorithms. It then times how long each algorithm takes to sort the array. The program then outputs the sorted array and the time it took to sort the array.

This shows that the bubble sort algorithm is slower than the merge sort algorithm.
